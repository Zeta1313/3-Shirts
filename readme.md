## 🛍️ Project Description

**3-Shirts** is a full-stack ecommerce web application focused on selling high-quality, stylish shirts for everyday wear. Our platform allows customers to browse products, view detailed descriptions, add items to their cart, and securely complete purchases. The Name is derived from the permanant deal of "Buy two shirts get a third for free" that the company uses as their main tagline.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate modern web development practices including structured architecture, clean UI design, and secure backend integration.
